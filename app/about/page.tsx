						<p>
							Hi there<span className="wave mx-1">üëãüèª</span> I&apos;m Arunava,
							a 19-year-old guy, passionate about computers.
						</p>
						<p>
							My journey began in 6th or 7th grade when I installed Linux on my
							computer, seeking something new beyond the dull Windows
							environment. Since then, I&apos;ve never looked back. I got into
							the terminal, learned Python, engaged in basic shell scripting,
							automated stuff, scraped websites, tweaked system services, and
							enjoyed breaking stuff to understand how things work.
						</p>
						<p>
							Later, I explored web development, working with various
							technologies, libraries, and frameworks. I learned about backend
							operations, databases, scalability, and real-time communications.
						</p>

						How I Tech
					</h2>
					<div className="flex flex-col gap-6">
						<p>
							As a full-stack developer, my primary focus involves handling both
							backend operations and user interface development. For robust
							tasks requiring performance and scalability, I rely on Golang,
							while for typical backend functionalities, I turn to NodeJS.
							Additionally, I use React (Next.js) for creating user interfaces,
							and I enhance the styling with TailwindCSS.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have several years of experience working with these
							technologies, as well as experience in other languages such as
							TypeScript, Python, C++, Elixir, and Rust, ranked in order from
							most to least experienced.
						</p>
						<p>
							In a nutshell, I&apos;m all about breaking down complex tech
							stuff, building cool things, and having some fun along the way!
